# Executive
A really simple to use library to run (execute) repetitive tasks and one-off tasks that will run after a specified delay.

This library doesn't use interrupts or try to do any pseudo-parallel running it just
does the best it can to keep your tasks running to a schedule.
Your program needs to pass control over to Exec for a period of time (e.g. using the 
Exec.delay() function) and the library will run any of your tasks that are already due to run or that fall due to run during that period.
Even if some of your tasks take a long time then the library will just do its best to execute tasks
fairly. It works on the basis that the most overdue task will get run first.

Very often, even for quite complex sketches, we end up with a program that is a set of 
tasks to be run at intervals.  In this case you can pass over control entirely to Exec
with the Exec.loop() call.
